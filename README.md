# mtm6201 Final Project

## Process
Most of the process was pretty simple, bootstrap makes building websites a lot easier. The only big struggle was getting the table to work properly, which I did not manage to fully figure out. The cells length keeps adjusting itself according to content and does not let me put a specific width value. Otherwise everything went more or less smooth, I think I got it close-ish to the reference. Another thing I struggled with were the margins basically in the whole layout, because it is tough to add them without messing the whole thing up.
